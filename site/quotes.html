              <p>The interest and excitement about Scala continues to grow.  
                It's great to see Lift reaching the 1.0 milestone as this is a 
                proof point for the maturity of Scala as a software platform.</p>

              <p>Lift is the only new framework in the last four years to offer fresh and innovative approaches to web development. It's not just some incremental improvements over the status quo, it redefines the state of the art. If you are a web developer, you should learn Lift. Even if you don't wind up using it everyday, it will change the way you approach web applications.</p>

              <p>Lift's excellent 'Comet made easy' philosophy made it an absolute no-brainer as the choice of framework for the Apache ESME project. Additionally, the fact that Lift-based applications run unchanged on the SAP's NetWeaver CE Java application server makes this an intriguing approach for enterprise applications in the SAP world.</p>

              <p>The slight added complexity of static typing is more than offset 
                by the performance, scalability, and the benefits of type safety. 
                Lift is maturing rapidly and has already proven itself many times 
                over, and it will only get better.</p>
              <p>As much as I liked Ruby and Rails, I like Scala and Lift better. 
                After more than two years of developing software in Ruby/Rails, we've 
                shifted all our development efforts to Scala/Lift. 
                And we are not looking back.</p>

              <p>When I decided to put Innovation GamesÂ® online, I knew that I couldn't afford a 
                massive development effort. I needed a small, sharp team who could leverage best-in-class 
                tools to help us solve the problems we knew that we'd have to solve in creating 
                a new kind of collaborative gaming experience on the web. David suggested 
                Lift and Scala and initial testing proved that we could realize the 
                developer efficiency and backend scalability that we felt was required to 
                efficiently support thousands of simultaneous games. We're now very comfortable 
                with Lift and Scala and are pleased with how the solution framework continues to evolve 
                to meet our needs. While we've used lift to push the boundaries of interactive web design, 
                I strongly recommend anyone who wants to build a compelling web experience using an 
                elegant framework to consider using Lift.</p>

              <p>If you're looking for a web framework on a strongly typed functional language and the JVM, Lift is the only game in town. Oh, and it just works, too.</p>
